# Reconstruction of surfaces from point cloud data

In this project, we give a new method for the manifold reconstruction of surfaces, embedded in high dimensional spaces as point cloud data, based on the computation of quotient identifications from the original data onto a 2-dimensional projection. 

Our method is based on the “naive” algorithm given in the paper [[1]](#1) which provides a general framework called Riemannian manifold learning for manifold reconstruction from point clouds. The framework attempts to preserve the underlying surface’s intrinsic Riemannian structure from the data
