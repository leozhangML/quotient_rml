Our quotient algorithm relies on the \"naive\" projection algorithm in [[2]](#2) being able to assign all the gluing/short-circuit points, which canonically form the quotient, to the boundary of the projection."

We can see from the \"tear\" points in the pointcloud, which form a bouquet of two circles, that the points making up the other 1-cycle in the torus are projected to opposing sides in the projection, inside the boundary. This results in `show_connections=True` only showing a single pair of glued edges. \n",

Due to the different positions of the 1-cycles, only one is assigned to the boundary.\n",
