The standard values the paper [[2]](#2) recommends are `k=10, threshold_var=0.08, edge_sen=1`.\n",

We take the local dimension of this neighbourhood to be the \"knee\" point of the curve given by `PCA.explained_variance_ratio_` from `scikit-learn`. We use the function `KneeLocator` from the python package `kneed`, which takes the parameter `S1`, to locate the \"knee\" point; we take `S1=0.2` as default.

We take the neighbouring points of the predecessor, on this path, to the generic point, whose projections are already computed, and use this local information to compute the projection of the generic point. We need at least the estimated dimension number of neighbouring points to compute the projection.\n",

If the ratio of the mean projected length and the mean pointcloud length is greater than `a`, we classify this point as a \"tear\" point. We plot these as red crosses.

However looking at `S_rp2.show_boundary`, we see that due to the randomness in our data, we have a short-circuit point with two such connections whereas a single connection is necessary and sufficient.
