    "Full explanations of the parameters `k`, `threshold_var` and `edge_sen` can be found in the paper [[2]](#2) under the \"naive\" algorithm; these parameters control the construction of the 1-skeleton on our data under `build_simplex`. From this 1-skeleton, we compute the estimated dimension of our pointcloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly, `k` is the parameter for the KNN 1-skeleton that we start with and that we refine through \"visible\" then \"safe\" edges. The parameters `threshold_var` and `edge_sen` control the quality of the edges that we take. Higher values of `threshold_var` and `edge_sen` result in more edges being kept. The standard values the paper [[2]](#2) recommends are `k=10, threshold_var=0.08, edge_sen=1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the intrinsic dimension of our pointcloud, for each point, we take the set of its neighbouring points (in the computed 1-skeleton) and apply PCA. We take the local dimension of this neighbourhood to be the \"knee\" point of the curve given by `PCA.explained_variance_ratio_` from `scikit-learn`. We use the function `KneeLocator` from the python package `kneed`, which takes the parameter `S1`, to locate the \"knee\" point; we take `S1=0.2` as default. The overall estimated dimension is then the mode of all the local estimated dimensions.\n",

    "Our implementation introduces the extra parameter `k0` for the computation of the projection under `normal_coords`. We found this necessary in order to make the algorithm to work. Originally, in order to compute the projection of a generic point, we find the shortest path from the base point (of our projection) to our generic point by Dijkstra's algorithm. We take the neighbouring points of the predecessor on this path to the generic point, whose projections are already computed, and use this local information to compute the projection of the generic point. We need at least the estimated dimension number of neighbouring points to compute the projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found in implementing this algorithm that we would regularly run into points, throughout the pointcloud, which do not have enough neighbouring points to correctly compute the projection. To correct this, we instead take the set of neighbouring points (which already have their projection computed) of the neighbouring points (which already have their projection computed) of the predecessor point (we exclude the predecessor point) and take the estimated dimension plus `k0` points which are closest to our generic point. Hence, `k0` controls how local we require our local data to be, in computing projections.\n",
